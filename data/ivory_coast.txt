Current Affairs
Domestic Politics 

In 2010, Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to accept his defeat in the presidential election led to an armed conflict that resulted in more than 3,000 deaths. Alassane Ouattara's investiture in May 2011 ended a decade of crisis. Re-elected in 2015, President Ouattara was reappointed for a third term in 2020 following the death of his designated successor, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, in a context marked by an opposition boycott and violence (89 deaths).  

A series of conciliatory gestures led most opposition parties to present candidates in the legislative elections of March 6, 2021, where the presidential party (RHDP) won a comfortable majority. Laurent Gbagbo, acquitted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in March 2021, returned to Côte d'Ivoire in June 2021 after 10 years abroad. He was pardoned in August 2022 by President Ouattara for his conviction in the so-called "BCEAO robbery" case and founded the "People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire" (PPA-CI). In November 2022, Charles Blé Goudé, also acquitted by the ICC, also returned to Côte d'Ivoire. However, both remain ineligible according to court rulings.  

The municipal and regional elections of September 2, 2023, the first local elections since 2001, were held peacefully, with representation from all political forces. They confirmed the preeminence of the presidential party, which won 123 municipalities, against 34 for the two main opposition parties, PDCI and PPA-CI.  

On October 17, 2023, President Ouattara announced the composition of a new government with Robert Beugré Mambé as Prime Minister.  

On the security front, the situation has improved since Alassane Ouattara's election in 2010, and the state has restored its authority over the entire territory, previously divided since 2004. However, Côte d'Ivoire remains exposed to jihadist threats. On March 13, 2016, the beach resort of Grand-Bassam, near Abidjan, was the site of a terrorist attack that killed 19 people (including four French nationals), claimed by AQIM. In June 2020, 12 security personnel were killed during an attack on the Kafolo border post. Since March 2021, around 20 incidents have been recorded in the northeast of the country due to the efforts of terrorist groups to establish themselves in the northern Gulf of Guinea countries, notably through Burkina Faso. While no incidents have been reported since 2022, Côte d'Ivoire faces a significant influx of Burkinabé refugees (the total number of asylum seekers in the country is estimated to be around 66,000 according to the latest UNHCR estimates). In response to the security threat, the Ivorian government has announced measures, including strengthening the military presence at the border with Burkina Faso and implementing social programs in the region.

Foreign Policy 

The international community and African institutions were highly involved in the Ivorian crisis over the past decade, through mediations and sanctions processes. Following Alassane Ouattara’s effective rise to power, the African Union lifted its sanctions, and the UN followed suit on April 28, 2016. After a Security Council decision, the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (ONUCI) officially ended on June 30, 2017.  

Côte d'Ivoire is particularly active in regional forums, benefiting from the experience and network of its political leaders, its ties to many neighboring countries (due to the large diasporas present on its territory), and its economic weight. In addition to being a member of ECOWAS and UEMOA, Côte d'Ivoire is part of the Accra Initiative, which aims to combat the terrorist threat (the multinational mixed force of the Accra Initiative has yet to be launched) and the Yaoundé Architecture for combating maritime insecurity. In terms of international politics, Côte d'Ivoire has voted in favor of all UN General Assembly resolutions on the war in Ukraine and has hosted a Ukrainian embassy since April 2024.

Côte d'Ivoire is the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), representing 40% of the region’s GDP. The country has strong infrastructure: the second-largest port in Sub-Saharan Africa, a significant road network, and a recently expanded international airport. It is the world’s largest cocoa producer, controlling more than 40% of the market. The country achieves energy self-sufficiency through the exploitation of gas and oil fields, enabling it to export electricity and petroleum products to the subregion.

After the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Côte d'Ivoire has returned to strong growth (6.5% in 2024). Despite a rise in inflation in 2022, it remains moderate (3.8% in 2024), and the budget deficit, which widened due to economic support measures for COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, has gradually decreased (4% in 2024), though concerns about debt sustainability (59.3% of GDP in 2024) remain.  
While the country was no longer under an IMF program since December 2020, the IMF Board approved a new unprecedented economic and financial program of 3.5 billion USD in 2023. In March 2024, an agreement was also reached with the IMF for a loan of 1.3 billion USD to assist Abidjan in preparing its energy transition. In January 2024, the Ivorian government launched two bond issuance tranches totaling 2.6 billion USD in Eurobonds. Côte d'Ivoire is still marked by persistent socio-economic disparities. Some social indicators (maternal and infant mortality, education quality) fall below Sub-Saharan averages. The country ranks 166th out of 193 countries in the latest UN Human Development Index. Nearly 80% of the country’s economic activity is concentrated in Abidjan, which houses less than a quarter of the national population. Furthermore, the economy remains largely informal, with an estimated share of 30-40% of GDP.

The Ivorian authorities have developed a national development plan for 2021-2025, with objectives to accelerate the structural transformation of the economy, strengthen social inclusion, double GDP per capita by 2030, and achieve upper-middle-income status by 2030.
